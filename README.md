# next-markdown-demo

A repository with only markdown files.

[`next-markdown`](https://github.com/frouo/next-markdown) will generate static web pages from this repo.

Note that, by default, `next-markdown` ignores `README.md` files. You can override this behavior by defining your own `include: (file, frontMatter, html) => boolean` function.
